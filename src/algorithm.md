    - If the current numbered card does match color or number then it should be ranked as 1:
    - If you have more than one color or number that can match it choose based on which you have more color cards of
    - If there is a scenario where you have the same amount of each color, choose the card that are numbered 1-9 randomly 
    - If you only only have 0 numbered cards choose randomly 
- Action cards ranking:
    Any reverse card that can be played has a ranking of 2
    - If the person in front of you has more cards, the reverse ranking should be 1
    - If the person behind you has more cards, the reverse ranking should be 3
    - If the person behind and in front have an absolute difference amount of cards that is 1, the ranking is 2
