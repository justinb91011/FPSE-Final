# Overview

Group Members: Justin Bravo, Robert Velez, Griffin Montalvo

We are going to make a digital version of the card game UNO. The user will play against other computer-generated players, and the game will enforce the rules of UNO (e.g., skip turns, reverse order, and draw cards). Our particular implementation will have three difficulties:

- Easy
- Medium
- Hard

The medium and hard difficulties will make use of an algorithm we are planning to build from the ground up using our very own ranking system.

We will also create a front-end for the game that includes the options to save and load games.


Possible List of Libraries:
- Core: For handling the core logic of the game.
- Yojson/Sexp: For persistence (storing game state) in the command-line version.
